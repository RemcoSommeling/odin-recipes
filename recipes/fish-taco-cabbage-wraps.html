    <h1>fish taco cabbage wraps</h1>

    <p>Spicy white fish wrapped in cabbage with a tasty wasabi-mayonnaise sauce. A delicious and easy way to enjoy fish tacos on a low-carb diet! You can also add a quick fresh pico de gallo to this if your diet allows tomatoes. Delicious! I now enjoy this more than regular fish tacos. Try this also with halibut or tilapia.</p>
